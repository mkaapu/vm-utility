Usage: mp-launch [options] [[<remote:>]<image> | <url>]

Create and start a new virtual machine (VM) instance using multipass tool
and enable acccess to the VM instance from host machine through SSH.

Example of creating a new virtual machine with a static IP address:
$ ./mp-launch --name my-vm --ip 10.10.10.10

Options:
  -h, --help                            Displays help on commandline options.
  -v, --verbose                         Increase logging verbosity. Repeat the
                                        'v' in the short option for more detail.
                                        Maximum verbosity is obtained with 4 (or
                                        more) v's, i.e. -vvvv.
  -c, --cpus <cpus>                     Number of CPUs to allocate.
                                        Minimum: 1, default: 1.

                                        Minimum: 512M, default: 5G.

                                        directory is mounted inside the newly

                                        IP address conflict detection with
                                        any existing addresses.

                                        'bridged' to use the interface
                                        configured via `multipass set

  --bridged                             Adds one `--network bridged` network.
  --mount <local-path>:<instance-path>  Mount a local directory inside the

  --timeout <timeout>                   Maximum time, in seconds, to wait for
                                        the VM instance to launch. Note that
                                        some background operations may continue
                                        beyond that. By default, instance
                                        startup and initialization is limited to
                                        5 minutes each.
  -T <timeout>                          Sets the timeout seconds for attempts to
                                        scan a public key from the VM instance
                                        to enable SSH connection from the host.
                                        The default is 30.
  -q, --quiet                           Silence mp-launch to not display usage.

                                        an Ubuntu release version, codename or
